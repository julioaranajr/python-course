# Python Syntax

## What is Syntax?

Python syntax refers to the set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted. It includes the rules for defining variables, functions, classes, and other elements of the Python programming language.

Python syntax is designed to be simple and easy to read, making it an ideal language for beginners to learn. By following the rules of Python syntax, you can write correct and readable code that can be easily understood by other programmers.

## Python Syntax rules

Python syntax is designed to be simple and easy to read. The following are some of the most important Python syntax rules:

- Python is case-sensitive.
- Python statements must end with a newline character.
- Python uses indentation to define code blocks.

We will cover these syntax rules in more detail in the [course content](/course_content/01_python_syntax.md).

## Example

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!") # print() is a function we will learn about later
```

## How to write Python code

- To write Python code, you can use any text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook.
- You can save your Python code in a file with a `.py` extension, such as `my_program.py`, and run it using the Python interpreter.

```bash
python my_program.py
```

- You can also run Python code interactively using the Python shell or an online Python interpreter such as [repl.it](https://repl.it/).

```bash
python
```

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## When to use Python Syntax

You should use Python syntax whenever you write a Python program. Python syntax defines the rules for writing Python code, and following these rules will ensure that your code is correct and easy to read.

## Summary

Python syntax refers to the set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted. It includes the rules for defining variables, functions, classes, and other elements of the Python programming language. Python syntax is designed to be simple and easy to read, making it an ideal language for beginners to learn.
