# Python built-in functions

Python has a rich set of `built-in functions` that are available for use `without` the need to import `any modules`. These functions are designed to perform common tasks such as mathematical operations, string manipulation, data type conversion, and more.

## What are Python built-in functions?

Python built-in functions are functions that are built into the Python interpreter and are always available for use.

## How many Python built-in functions are there?

Python has a total of `68 built-in functions` that are available for use without the need to import any modules. These functions are designed to perform common tasks such as mathematical operations, string manipulation, data type conversion, and more.

## What are some commonly used Python built-in functions?

The following are some of the most commonly used Python built-in functions:

- `abs()`: Returns the absolute value of a number.

- `help()`: Invokes the built-in help system.
- `hex()`: Converts an integer to a hexadecimal string.
- `id()`: Returns the identity of an object.
- `input()`: Reads a line from input and returns it as a string.
- `int()`: Returns an integer object.
- `isinstance()`: Returns `True` if an object is an instance of a specified class.
- `issubclass()`: Returns `True` if a class is a subclass of a specified class.
- `iter()`: Returns an iterator object.
- `len()`: Returns the length of an object.
- `list()`: Returns a list.
- `locals()`: Returns an updated dictionary of the current local symbol table.
- `map()`: Applies a function to all the items in an input iterable.
- `max()`: Returns the largest item in an iterable.
- `memoryview()`: Returns a memory view object.
- `min()`: Returns the smallest item in an iterable.
- `next()`: Returns the next item in an iterator.
- `object()`: Returns a new object.
- `oct()`: Converts an integer to an octal string.
- `open()`: Opens a file and returns a file object.
- `ord()`: Returns an integer representing the Unicode code of a specified character.
- `pow()`: Returns the value of x to the power of y.
- `print()`: Prints the specified message to the screen.
- `property()`: Returns a property value.
- `range()`: Returns a sequence of numbers.
- `repr()`: Returns a readable version of an object.
- `reversed()`: Returns a reversed iterator.
- `round()`: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimals.
- `set()`: Returns a set object.
- `setattr()`: Sets the value of the specified attribute of an object.
- `slice()`: Returns a slice object.
- `sorted()`: Returns a sorted list.
- `staticmethod()`: Converts a method into a static method.
- `str()`: Returns a string object.
- `sum()`: Sums the items of an iterator.
- `super()`: Returns a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class.
- `tuple()`: Returns a tuple.
- `type()`: Returns the type of an object.
- `vars()`: Returns the `__dict__` attribute of an object.
- `zip()`: Returns an iterator of tuples.
- `__import__()`: Imports a module.

## How to use Python built-in functions?

To use a Python built-in function, you simply call the function by its name and pass the required arguments. For example, to use the `abs()` function to get the absolute value of a number, you would write:

```python
result = abs(-5)
print(result)
```

This would output `5`, which is the absolute value of `-5`.

## Summary

Python has a rich set of built-in functions that are available for use without the need to import any modules. These functions are designed to perform common tasks such as mathematical operations, string manipulation, data type conversion, and more. By using Python built-in functions, you can write more efficient and concise code that is easier to read and maintain.
