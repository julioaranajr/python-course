# Python Comments

## Why use Comments?

Comments are used to explain the code and make it easier to understand. They are `ignored` by the Python interpreter and do not affect the execution of the program.

## Comments in Python

In Python, comments start with the `#` symbol and continue until the end of the line. The Python interpreter ignores everything after the `#` symbol on a line.

```python
1 # This is a comment
2 print("Hello, World!")  # This is also a comment
3 # print("This line is commented out")
```

## Multi-line Comments

Python does not have a built-in syntax for multi-line comments. To create multi-line comments, you can use multiple single-line comments or a multi-line string.

```python
1 # This is a multi-line comment
2 # It consists of multiple single-line comments
3 # to create a multi-line effect
4 # in the code


1"""
This is also a multi-line comment
It consists of a multi-line string
to create a multi-line effect
in the code
"""
2 print("Hello, World!")
3 # print("This line is commented out")
```

## When to Use Comments

- Use comments to explain the purpose of the code.
- Use comments to explain complex parts of the code.
- Use comments to document the code for future reference.
- Use comments to make the code easier to understand for others.

## Commenting Best Practices

- Keep comments concise and to the point.
- Use comments to explain why the code is written a certain way, not what the code does.
- Avoid unnecessary comments that repeat what the code already says.
- Update comments when the code changes to keep them accurate and relevant.

## Summary

- Comments are used to explain the code and make it easier to understand.
- Comments start with the `#` symbol and continue until the end of the line.
- Python does not have a built-in syntax for multi-line comments, but you can use multiple single-line comments or a multi-line string to create multi-line comments.
- Use comments to explain the purpose of the code, document complex parts of the code, and make the code easier to understand for others.
