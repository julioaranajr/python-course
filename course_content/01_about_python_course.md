# Python Intro

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

- web development (server-side),
- software development,
- mathematics,
- system scripting,
- data analysis,
- artificial intelligence,
- machine learning,
- deep learning,
- scientific computing,
- and more...

Python is known for its simplicity and readability. It is easy to learn and use, and it has a large community of users.

Python is a high-level programming language, which means it is easy to read and write. It is also an interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before it is run.

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that you do not need to declare the type of a variable when you create one.

Python is a general-purpose language, which means it can be used to build just about anything, which will be made easy with the right tools/libraries.

## What can Python do?

- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
- Python can be used in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.
- Python can be used in scientific computing.
- Python can be used to create desktop applications.
- Python can be used to create games.
- Python can be used to create mobile applications.
- Python can be used to create web applications.
- Python can be used for embedded programming.
- Python can be used for testing.
- Python can be used for data visualization.
- and much more...

## Why Python?

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way, or a functional way.
