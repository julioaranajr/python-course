# Python Comments

## What are Python Comments?

Python comments are annotations in the source code that are ignored by the Python interpreter. They are used to document the code and make it easier to understand for other developers (or your future self).

Comments can be used to explain the purpose of the code, provide context for complex algorithms, or add reminders for future improvements. They are an essential part of writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## How to write Python Comments?

Python comments start with the `#` character and continue until the end of the line. They can be placed on a line by themselves or at the end of a line of code.

Here are some examples of Python comments:

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This is an inline comment
```

You can also write multi-line comments by using multiple single-line comments:

```python
# This is a multi-line comment
# It spans multiple lines
# And provides additional context
```

Another way to write multi-line comments is to enclose the text in triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`):

```python
'''
This is a multi-line comment
It spans multiple lines
And provides additional context
'''
```

## Why are Python Comments important?

Python comments are important because they help you and other developers understand the code. They provide context, explanations, and reminders that make it easier to read and maintain the code.

By writing clear and concise comments, you can communicate your intentions, thought process, and design decisions to others. This can be especially helpful when working on a team, collaborating on a project, or revisiting code after a long time.

## Summary

In this article, we learned about Python comments, which are annotations in the source code that are ignored by the Python interpreter. We learned how to write single-line and multi-line comments using the `#` character and triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).

We also learned about the importance of Python comments in documenting the code, providing context, and making it easier to understand and maintain. By writing clear and concise comments, you can improve the readability and usability of your Python programs.
